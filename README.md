# CT_Image_Reconstruction

This project gives a demonstration of reconstructing CT images from the scan projections.

## Three reconstruction algorithms are implemented here.

--> Filtered Backprojection (see main.m and part1.m)

--> Gridding Reconstruction (see part2.m)

--> Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (see myNUFFT.m)
